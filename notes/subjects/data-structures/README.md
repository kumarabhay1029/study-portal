# 📊 Data Structures Notes

This folder contains comprehensive study materials on data structures and their implementations.

## 📂 Data Structure Categories:

### 📝 Linear Data Structures:
- **Arrays**: Static and dynamic arrays
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists
- **Stacks**: LIFO operations and applications
- **Queues**: FIFO operations, priority queues, circular queues

### 🌳 Non-Linear Data Structures:
- **Trees**: Binary trees, BST, AVL trees, B-trees
- **Graphs**: Directed/undirected graphs, weighted graphs
- **Heaps**: Min-heap, max-heap, heap operations
- **Hash Tables**: Hash functions, collision handling

### 🔍 Advanced Structures:
- **Tries**: Prefix trees for string operations
- **Segment Trees**: Range query optimization
- **Disjoint Sets**: Union-find operations
- **Balanced Trees**: Red-black trees, splay trees

## 💡 Key Concepts:
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Implementation techniques
- Use cases and applications
- Performance comparisons
