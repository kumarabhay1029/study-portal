# 📋 Google Forms Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Study Portal now supports Google Forms integration for collecting notes, assignments, projects, and research papers. This guide will help you set up the forms and embed them in your portal.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Google Forms

You need to create 5 Google Forms:

#### 📝 Notes Forms (2 forms needed)
1. **Free Notes Submission Form**
   - Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com)
   - Create a new form titled "Study Portal - Free Notes Submission"
   - Add fields:
     - Subject (dropdown)
     - Topic/Title (text)
     - Description (paragraph text)
     - File Upload (allow multiple files, max 10MB)
     - Student Name (text)
     - Email (email)

2. **Premium Notes Submission Form**
   - Similar to free form but titled "Study Portal - Premium Notes Submission"
   - Add additional fields:
     - Payment Reference (text)
     - Special Requirements (paragraph text)

#### 📤 Other Content Forms (3 forms needed)
3. **Assignments Submission Form**
4. **Projects Submission Form** 
5. **Research Papers Submission Form**

### 2. Get Form Embed URLs

For each form:
1. Click "Send" button in Google Forms
2. Click the embed icon (`<>`)
3. Copy the iframe URL (the part inside `src="..."`)
4. It should look like: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true`

### 3. Update Your JavaScript

Open `js/google-forms-manager.js` and update the `formUrls` object with your actual form URLs:

```javascript
this.formUrls = {
    notes: {
        free: 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FREE_NOTES_FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true',
        premium: 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_PREMIUM_NOTES_FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true'
    },
    assignments: 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS_FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true',
    projects: 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_PROJECTS_FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true',
    research: 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_RESEARCH_FORM_ID/viewform?embedded=true'
};
```

### 4. Set Up Google Sheets for Data Collection

1. Each form automatically creates a Google Sheet with responses
2. You can access these sheets from your Google Drive
3. Set up email notifications for new submissions:
   - In Google Sheets, go to Tools > Notification rules
   - Set to notify you when "Any changes are made"

### 5. Content Approval Workflow

1. **Receive Submissions**: Forms submit to Google Sheets
2. **Review Content**: Check submissions in your Google Sheets
3. **Approve/Reject**: Add approved content to your portal's browse sections
4. **Update Portal**: Manually add approved content cards to the browse grids
